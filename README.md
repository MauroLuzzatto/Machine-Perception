## Dynamic Gesture Recognition - ABSTRACT
Methods relying on neural networks have demonstrated astounding results for solving various problems, ranging from image classification to speech recognition. However, extracting information from the temporal structure in video data remains a challenging task.
Based on previous work done in the field by Pigou et al. and Molchanov et al. we aim at implementing a neural network, that
is able of reaching performance comparable with the state of the art. Furthermore, we suggest some changes to the data augmentation
used in previous work, that has the potential to further improve the performance.
